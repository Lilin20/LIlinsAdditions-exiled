# **Lilin’s Additions**

Hey everyone! 👋  
Welcome to my newest project — **Lilin’s Additions**!

I’ve made a few plugins before, but this one has been my main focus for quite some time. It actually started as a **private plugin** for my own server (just a small group of friends), but since we don’t play as actively anymore, I decided to release it publicly so my work doesn’t just sit and rot away. 😅  

Before you go diving into the GitHub page — **yes, the code is messy**.  
It was never meant for public release, but I’m actively cleaning it up and optimizing various parts as I go. This first version is more of a **test release**, so expect some bugs and rough edges that I’ll polish over time.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- This is a **test release** – features were removed, changed, or reworked for compatibility.  
- Expect **bugs, issues, and unfinished features** – report them so I can fix things faster.  
- The plugin currently **requires multiple dependencies** (sorry about that — I’ll try to reduce them later).

## 📦 Installation Tips

Before installing:
1. **Backup your existing configs** — this plugin has a large and complex configuration file.  
2. I highly recommend using **separate config files** for organization.  
3. I’m working on a **custom config loader** to simplify setup in future versions.

## ❤️ Final Notes

This is something I built out of passion, not perfection.  
I'm sharing it because my own private server isn't that active anymore and i don*t want this plugin to be wasted.
Feedback, suggestions, and bug reports are more than welcome!
